### Projects:
0. Search 
1. Wiki 
2. Commerce 
3. Mail 
4. Network
5. Final Project: Capstone.

The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your website will be up to you, subject to some constraints as indicated below.

### REQUIREMENTS:

In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those.

A project that appears to be a social network is a priori deemed by the staff to be indistinct from Project 4, and should not be submitted; it will be rejected.

A project that appears to be an e-commerce site is strongly suspected to be indistinct from Project 2, and your README.md file should be very clear as to why it’s not. Failing that, it should not be submitted; it will be rejected.

Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.

Your web application must be mobile-responsive.

In a README.md in your project’s main directory, include a writeup describing your project, and specifically your file MUST include all of the following: Under its own header within the README called Distinctiveness and Complexity: Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

What’s contained in each file you created.

### How to run your application.

Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to a requirements.txt file!

Though there is not a hard requirement here, a README.md in the neighborhood of 500 words is likely a solid target, assuming the other requirements are also satisfied.

Failure to adhere to these requirements WILL result in a failing grade for the project, and you will need to wait and resubmit.

Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to you!
